This site is a submission which was to be graded as the last task for the fourth semester. In this task, I was to create a front end for a venue booking service called Holidaze.

## Description

- Holidaze is a venue booking site where users may:
- Register an account
- Log in
- View the most recent venues added
- Scroll infinitely through venues
- View posts with more than one image in a carousel
- Search through venues to find the one they would like to book
- View a specific venue in more detail
- See availability for said venue
- Book a venue if logged in
- View their profile
- Edit their profile
- View another person's profile
- Create a new venue if their account is a venue manager
- View their own venues, delete, or update said venue
- View their upcoming bookings
- Manage a venue they own, as well as see who has booked the venue and when they have booked it

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Bootstrap React
- React Datepicker
- JavaScript
- React Router
- React Icons

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the people I surveyed for the user-testing. Their feedback and the replays from Hotjar of their interaction with the website definitely improved the overall functionality and quality of the site. I have a tendency to overlook certain things, and it's very difficult to imagine myself as a user of the site when coding it myself.
